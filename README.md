This is a Open Live Wallpaper fork it, have fun, but don't forget to mention it okay?


The idea was that you can get so much more from a live wallpaper.
Not only it can be cute, but can also tell you stuff without using words.

Based on this idea, the first version is just showing a simple landscape that adpats to the time of the day an a small tree that changes according to the battery level.
What I want is to change it according to where you are and incorporate information that comes for free on your phone. Things like altitude, tides, temperature, noise level, wind direction, weather, storage, system load and much more.
The only rule is that words are forbidden, the wallpaper must transmit its messages using only changes in the landscape.
That's the fun in it.
